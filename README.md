# QuestionAnswer

<i>This is a question answering system made using BERT. <br/ ><br/ ><br/ > In this we collected many paragraphs regarding ipod, along with questions related to them.<br/ ><br/ > Whenever a user enters a questions in the input, the similarity of the question is checked with all the questions which are available in the dataset. The question which is most similar to the question entered by the user is used. Now, every paragraph in our dataset is linked to multiple questions. So, once we have found the most similar question, we input that question and the paragraph into the bert model. The bert model understands the paragraph and the questionand outputs the answer. After which we format the answer and display it.</i>
